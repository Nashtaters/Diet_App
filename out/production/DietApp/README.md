# Overview

I wrote this project to be better at getting user input and displaying messages according to certain inputs.

This project displays certain foods to avoid and pursue according to different diets, depending on the users input.

The purpose for writing this software was to get more comfortable with the Kotlin language

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* I would have liked to have added a loop to continue to the first input until the user selects end.
* I would have liked to have added a description of what each diet is trying to achieve.
* I would have liked to add workout routines to this to make a more fitness-like app.
